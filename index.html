  <h2> Origins of AOT! </h2> 
  
  <p> Attack on Titan is a Japanese action, dark mystery manga series written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama. It started airing on April 7th, 2013, and is one of the most popular manga series in Japan and one of the most anticapted anime this year as season four is continuing to air every Sunday since December 7th. The plot is centered around people living inside walls for as long as they can remember, fending off giant beasts called titans in order to survive. However, the plot only gets more complex as the episodes progress and by season four, it progresses to encompass ideas of morality, right and wrong, discrimination, etc.

   <h2>Why I Chose AOT Out Of Everything ^-^</h2>
  
  <p> I started watching "Attack On Titan" around 2017 and since then, it's kind of been a comfort show. I'm attached to it and to all the characters and love it with all my heart. The plot and its complexities are so interesting and also the strong female characters make it better :D!! (All the characters are well written too.) The concept alone is great as it is and it allows for more intricacies as the plot deepens.</p>

  <h2> Why You Should Watch It!! </h2>
  
  <p> You should watch it because the charcaters, plot, soundtrack, visuals, and everything in general are amazing and worth the hype. You can never just get bored because something interesting always happens, and youre either very upset, or on your toes, or smiling, or all the entire time.</p>
  <p> Here is a list of the characters: </p>

  <h2> Spinoffs </h2>
  
  <p> There is a series called "Attack on Titan Junior High" in which it's an alternate timeline and all the characters go to highschool! It'a very cute <333. Also, there are many OVAs to go along the series such as "Before the Falls" "Lost Girls" and "No Regrets" which are very enjoyable.
